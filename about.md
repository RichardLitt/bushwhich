		<h1>About Bushwhich</h1>
		<p>On January 7th, I made a post on Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/richard.littauer/posts/4382686000497">link</a>) offering to make a "handmade, special, unique, special gift" for the first five friends who commented. <b>Joe and Alex</b>, this is for you (not entirely unique, then, I know). It's a choose your own adventure (based on one day of my adventures) game through Bushwick, where I live. I've kept it simple, and it should be fairly straightforward. There are many endings, but it is possible to play the whole game. Thank Sam for helping me make it.</p>

		<p><b>Everyone else</b>: enjoy. You can find more about me on my website (<a href="http://www.burntfen.com">link</a>). If you really liked it, my paypal is my email there; donations are indeed welcome. If you live in Bushwick - let's go out for a drink! Drop me a line at richard dot littauer at gmail. </p>
